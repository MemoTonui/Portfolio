                My name is Linda Tonui, a 21 year old lady.
                My portfolio is a basic representation of who I am,
                 my level of education and all I have achieved this far.
                 <br><br>
                 I am a Computer Science student at Egerton University, Njoro Campus currently in 3rd year.
                 I finished my highschool education at the Nakuru Girls High School which is located in Nakuru.
                 I managed to attain a score of B+.
                 In primary school, i navigated through many schools but completed it in Le pic School scoring 401.
                 <br><br>
                My hobbies include singing, dancing(like everyone :) ) and baking. In relation to the skills I possess,
                I can code in various languages including JAVA, C ,python, I also like to believe that my prowess in cooking is great.
                I am currently interested in learning how to drive and perfecting my skills in coding.
                <br><br>
                Coding has been a passion of mine since forever. I decided to join Moringa School for the PREP program to perfect my self taught skills in html, CSS and javascript.
                After I am done with the PREP program, I intend to dive into Mobile Development hopefully before i get to go back to campus.
                Mobile Development has always been something i felt like i wanted to do.
